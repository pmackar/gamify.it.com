# Why I Built This


I like games. I like lifting. For years, I've treated lifting like a game - chasing the next level, grinding for achievements, setting goals, and attacking them with friends.
So I built an app to make it official. Iron Quest is designed to be powerful, fun to use, and to create that hook for newcomers and anyone who finds themselves lifting in seasons.
Campaigns, quests, seasonal challenges - we built these features to make your experience as engaging as possible.
