# Why I Built This

I've been lifting for years, but I kept falling off the wagon. Every fitness app felt like a chore—just another place to log data that nobody cared about.

Then I realized: I never quit playing video games. The XP, the levels, the achievements—they kept me coming back. What if the gym felt the same way?

Iron Quest is the app I wished existed. Every PR feels like defeating a boss. Every workout streak is a combo multiplier. The gym isn't a chore anymore. It's the best game I've ever played.
